    "<p>Raster data is any pixelated (or gridded) data where each pixel is associated\n",

    "continuous (e.g. elevation) or categorical (e.g. land use).</p>\n",
    "<p>If this sounds\n",
    "familiar, it is because this data structure is very common: it’s how\n",
    "we represent any digital image. A geospatial raster is only different\n",
    "from a digital photo in that it is accompanied by spatial information\n",
    "that connects the data to a particular location. This includes the\n",
    "raster’s extent and cell size, the number of rows and columns, and\n",
